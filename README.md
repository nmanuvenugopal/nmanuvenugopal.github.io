## Projects
### Few Shot Classification using Azure OpenAI
[Github Article](https://github.com/nmanuvenugopal/Few-Shot-classification-using-OpenAI)
This project leveraged OpenAI's cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to develop a sentiment analysis model. The objective was to classify sentences into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, aiming to enhance understanding of textual data emotions and opinions. Such analysis is pivotal for applications like customer feedback interpretation, market research, and monitoring social media content. Selecting OpenAI's NLP algorithms for the model's foundation, we capitalized on their advanced language comprehension. The training phase involved adjusting the model to recognize linguistic cues and patterns indicative of various sentiments. The model's architecture was fine-tuned to balance complexity and performance, ensuring efficient training and high accuracy.

The highlight of the project was achieving an accuracy rate of almost or more than 98%, a testament to the model's exceptional capability in sentiment classification. This high accuracy reflects the model's nuanced understanding of language and sentiment expression, positioning it as a valuable tool for analyzing textual sentiments. 

### Build a Conversational RAG with Mistral-7B and LangChain
[Github Article](https://github.com/nmanuvenugopal/Build-a-Conversational-RAG-with-Mistral-7B-and-LangChain)
This project focused on developing a state-of-the-art Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model by leveraging the powerful Hugging Face Transformers library and the innovative LangChain framework. The goal was to enhance conversational AI's ability to generate more informative, accurate, and contextually relevant responses by integrating external knowledge sources directly into the dialogue system.

The development process involved:
- Selecting an appropriate transformer model as the foundation for our RAG system (In my case I have used Mistral AI), emphasizing its ability to handle conversational nuances.
- Implementing LangChain to link our model with external knowledge databases, ensuring dynamic data retrieval during conversations.
- Fine-tuning the combined model on a dataset tailored to conversational AI, focusing on enhancing its ability to generate coherent, context-aware, and information-rich responses

The project successfully created a Conversational RAG model that significantly outperforms traditional conversational agents in terms of response quality, relevance, and informativeness. This was evidenced by its ability to seamlessly integrate facts, figures, and detailed information into dialogues, providing users with a more engaging and informative interaction experience.
